Citizen Journalism Network Server
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

CJNS is an educational project that will hopefully one day prove useful. Initially a simple ASP.NET MVC 3 implementation of the Atom Publishing Protocol. Later in the project, it will have features for federated servers, geolocation, advanced searching, and ratings.

For the forseeable future, this project is for educational purposes only (my own primarily, and hopefully others if people actually find it useful for that purpose), and goes along with a journal of my efforts at:

As it matures from what it is now, it will evolve into something that will ideally be useful as either a starting point or a full reference implementation for a set of extensions to the Atom Publishing Protocol called "FreeSNAP": the Free Simple News Access Protocol. More details on the protocol and Atom extensions as they are dreamed up!
